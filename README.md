# BlockChain
This is my first project with BlockChain. Will do more updates later on in time.

For now, I have made a Java class that contains three classes:

Transactions: This class contains a fromAddress, toAddress and transferAmount field. This is important for money transfer between 2 users

 Block: A block contains a timestamp, hash, hash of previous block, and a nonce field which alters due to proof of work
 Blockchain: a blockchain contains an array of blocks, where the first block is a genesis block.
